# Sequence-to-Sequence Model For Machine Translation

This project implements a sequence-to-sequence model with attention mechanism for language translation tasks.


## Introduction

This project provides an implementation of a sequence-to-sequence model with attention, a powerful architecture for tasks like machine translation, text summarization, and more.

## Files

- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Notebooks for experimentation and model visualization.
- **Sample Data**: Sample datasets for training and testing the model.
- **dataloader.py**: Module for loading and preprocessing data.
- **seq2seq_model.py**: Implementation of the sequence-to-sequence model.
- **seq2seq_with_attention.py**: Implementation of the sequence-to-sequence model with attention mechanism.
- **test.py**: Script for testing the trained model.
- **train.py**: Script for training the sequence-to-sequence model.
- **utils.py**: Utility functions used throughout the project.

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies.
2. Prepare your data or use the provided sample data.
3. Train the model using `train.py`.
4. Test the trained model using `test.py`.
5. Experiment with different configurations using the Jupyter Notebooks.
